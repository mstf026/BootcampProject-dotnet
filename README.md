Basically, if a product has subpieces and if the company does not have enough subpiece to produce that product, they can not sell that product to client. This web application allows the seller to see if they have enough subpiece to produce a product. 
* Sellers can add the subpieces with its cost and stock. 
* Sellers can easily calculate selling price by setting the profit rate. 
* Sellers don't have to calculate the total cost for the product.
* Sellers can see the budget of each department they have.

I used .NET framework for backend. This web application has CRUD operations. I used entity framework for database connection. I used mssql for database. I also added JWT Authentication and Authorization to the project.
